# Video Trimmer and Splitter
This is a simple interface to ffmpeg tool. It uses a file called list.txt to get the required names of videos, start times, and end times.
An example is included in [the file](https://github.com/AhmedYasser5/video_editor/blob/main/list.txt).

## Syntax for list.txt
First line is the output file name

Each of the next lines are divided into groups of 3:

- The first line contains the input file name
  
- The second line contains the start at which you want to record
  
- The third line contains the end at which you want to stop recording
  
Keep adding groups of 3 as you wish :)
